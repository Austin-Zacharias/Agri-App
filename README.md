ðŸš€ How to Run the Application

This is a single-file application that requires a local web server and an API key to function correctly.

    Save the file: Save the index.html file to your computer.

    Get an API key: Go to the Google AI Studio and get a new API key for the Gemini API.

    Update the code: Open the index.html file and find the line const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with the key you just generated.

    Run a local server: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the file, and run one of the following commands to start a simple web server:

        For Python 3: python3 -m http.server

        For Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer

    Open in browser: In your web browser, go to http://localhost:8000. The application will now be fully functional.

Note: The app requires a local server to access external APIs due to browser security restrictions. Opening the file directly from your computer (file://) will not work.
